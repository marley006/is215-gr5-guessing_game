# is215-gr5-guessing_game
This repository contains the implementation codes created to play a guessing game against the OpenAI bot. Through a statically defined list of categories, OpenAI comes up with a word and provides 10 clues that will be shared with the player one at a time. This will give the player 10 attempts to guess the right word.

<br/>
<b>Project Overview: </b>
<p>The game is written using a single-page ReactJS implementation. The OpenAI keys are externalized for a more secure approach. </p>
